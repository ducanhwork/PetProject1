## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `be/` directory.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Build and run the project (Maven/Gradle as applicable).

### Frontend

1. Navigate to `fe/my-app/`.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will run locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📝 Notes

- Make sure you have Java, Node.js, and npm installed on your system.
- You may need to configure the API base URL in the frontend to match your backend's server address.
